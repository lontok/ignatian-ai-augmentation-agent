## üêõ Bug Fixes

### High Priority

- [ ] Session storage path persistence issue

### Medium Priority
- [ ] File size validation not working for large PDFs
- [ ] Error boundaries missing in key components

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Debt

### Infrastructure Improvements
- [ ] Migrate file uploads from local storage to AWS S3
  - Currently storing PDFs in backend/uploads/ directory
  - Need to implement S3 bucket configuration
  - Update upload endpoints to use S3
  - Add proper file lifecycle management
  - Implement secure presigned URLs for downloads

### Consolidation Needed
- [x] Merge `llm_service.py` and `enhanced_llm_service.py` - COMPLETED 2025-06-22
  - ‚úÖ Consolidated both services into single `llm_service.py`
  - ‚úÖ Kept enhanced prompts and methods
  - ‚úÖ Maintained backward compatibility
  - ‚úÖ Added new enhanced methods (reflection synthesis, interview questions)
  - ‚úÖ Deleted `enhanced_llm_service.py`

### TypeScript Improvements
- [ ] Add proper types for analysis results
- [ ] Create interfaces for LLM responses
- [ ] Type safety for API responses

### Performance
- [ ] Implement loading skeletons
- [ ] Add request caching for analysis
- [ ] Optimize bundle size

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Context Stage
- [ ] Validate all Ignatian extraction fields
- [ ] Test with various resume formats
- [ ] Verify questionnaire data persistence
- [ ] Test values inventory flow

### Experience Stage
- [ ] Multi-file upload handling
- [ ] File size limits (5 files max)
- [ ] Overlap analysis accuracy
- [ ] Venn diagram interactions

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Path switching scenarios
- [ ] Data persistence across stages
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

## üìö API Documentation Needs

### New Endpoints Required
```
POST /api/analysis/resume/start
{
  "resume_document_id": number
}

GET /api/analysis/resume/{id}

POST /api/jobs/multi-upload
{
  "files": File[],
  "mode": "exploration" | "interview"
}

GET /api/jobs/overlap-analysis/{job_ids}
```

### Existing Endpoints to Update
- `POST /api/analysis/start` - Add mode parameter
- `GET /api/documents/` - Add filtering by type

## üìù Notes & References

### Key Files
- LLM Service: `/backend/app/services/llm_service.py`
- Enhanced LLM: `/backend/app/services/enhanced_llm_service.py`
- Context Stage: `/frontend/src/pages/context/ContextStage.tsx`
- Path Selection: `/frontend/src/pages/PathSelection.tsx`

### Important Decisions
- Context = Resume only (not job descriptions)
- Experience = Job descriptions upload
- Two paths: Exploration (3-5 jobs) vs Interview Prep (1 job)
- Using GPT-4o-mini for all LLM operations

### Dependencies to Add
- D3.js for Venn diagram visualization
- React-dropzone for multi-file upload
- Lodash for overlap analysis utilities
