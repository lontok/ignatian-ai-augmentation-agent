        4. If you cannot find direct evidence in the resume for a job requirement, it MUST go in skill_gaps, NOT direct_matches
        5. For direct_matches, the candidate_evidence field is now an ARRAY of 1-2 exact quotes from the resume
        6. Try to find 2 different pieces of evidence from the resume for each requirement when possible
        7. Each evidence quote should be from a different section/experience in the resume
        8. Never put "â€” (no direct evidence)" in the direct_matches section - those belong in skill_gaps
        9. Include at least 3-5 direct matches (with real evidence) and 2-4 gaps
