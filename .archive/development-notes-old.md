# Development ‚Üî Documentation Communication
# Ignatian AI Augmentation Agent Project

## Branch Strategy
- **Development**: main branch (ignatian-ai-augmentation-agent directory)
- **Documentation**: docs-workspace branch (ignatian-ai-augmentation-agent-docs directory)
- **Sync**: Documentation periodically merges from main to stay current

## Current Development Status
- Status: Development Claude ACTIVE and ready for work
- Development branch: main
- Documentation branch: docs-workspace
- Last update: 2024-12-29
- **Major Update**: PRD updated with two-path system (Exploration & Interview Prep modes)

## Current Development Tasks

### üö® High Priority - Context Stage Enhancement

## 2025-06-21 Context Stage Gap Analysis

### Current Implementation vs Requirements

**What's Currently Built:**
1. ‚úÖ Document upload (resume + job description)
2. ‚úÖ LLM analysis pipeline (5-step process)
3. ‚úÖ Progress tracking during analysis
4. ‚úÖ Strengths/gaps identification
5. ‚úÖ Detailed evidence table with connections
6. ‚úÖ Role-fit narrative generation

**Critical Gaps from IPP Guide Requirements:**

1. **Personal Background Collection** (IPP Guide Phase 1)
   - ‚ùå No intake questionnaire for personal context
   - ‚ùå No family expectations/cultural values capture
   - ‚ùå No financial situation assessment
   - ‚ùå No geographic preferences collection
   - ‚ùå No personal relationships/commitments info
   - ‚ùå No health/life circumstances consideration

2. **Academic Profile** (IPP Guide Phase 1)
   - ‚ùå No major/minor/year collection
   - ‚ùå No GPA/achievements tracking
   - ‚ùå No coursework inventory
   - ‚ùå No extracurricular activities capture

3. **Professional Starting Point** (IPP Guide Phase 1)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial - resume parsing exists but no structured capture of:
     - Career assumptions/biases
     - Professional network info
     - Industry knowledge level

4. **Personal Story & Values** (IPP Guide emphasis)
   - ‚ùå No personal story prompts
   - ‚ùå No values inventory
   - ‚ùå No motivation/mission capture
   - ‚ùå No "Who is this person?" exploration

5. **Skills Inventory** (PRD requirement)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial - extracted from resume but no:
     - Self-assessment of skill levels
     - Skills categorization (technical/soft/transferable)
     - Skills the student wants to develop

**Critical Missing Features:**
- **Comprehensive intake questionnaire** before document upload
- **Personal story prompts** to understand the whole person
- **Background assessment tools** for context
- **Skills self-assessment** beyond resume extraction

**Impact of Gaps:**
- LLM lacks personal context for meaningful personalization
- Cannot tailor advice to student's life circumstances
- Missing values/motivations that should inform project suggestions
- No baseline for measuring growth through IPP journey

**Recommendation:**
Add a pre-upload questionnaire/wizard that captures personal context, making the Context stage truly about "understanding the whole person" as the IPP requires.

## 2024-12-29 PRD Update - Two-Path System

### Changes Made
**Major PRD Update**: Added two distinct user paths to support different job search scenarios

**Files Modified**: 
- docs/product/prd.md (comprehensive update)
- docs/product/ipp-guide.md (clarified upload flow)
- CLAUDE.local.md (created for local development context)

**Key Changes**:
1. **Path Selection**: 
   - Exploration Mode: Upload 3-5 job descriptions, create multi-target project
   - Interview Prep Mode: Upload 1 job description, create focused project

2. **Flow Clarification**:
   - Context = Resume upload only (understanding who you are)
   - Experience = Job description upload(s) (exploring opportunities)

3. **Multi-Target Project Approach**:
   - Smart overlap analysis across multiple jobs
   - Coverage scoring (e.g., "This project addresses 85% of Role A")
   - Venn diagram visualization
   - Strategic value proposition for interviews

4. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Multi-file upload interface needed
   - Overlap analysis algorithm implementation
   - Coverage scoring system
   - D3.js visualizations

**Documentation Needed**: 
- API specs for multi-upload endpoints
- User guides for each path
- Technical documentation for overlap analysis

**Testing Required**: 
- Path selection flow
- Multi-upload functionality
- Overlap analysis accuracy
- Coverage scoring validation

**Status**: PRD complete, ready for implementation

## 2025-01-21 Development Update - Context Stage Analysis
**Changes Made**: Analyzed gap between PRD Context stage specifications and actual implementation
**Files Modified**: docs/development-notes.md
**Key Findings**: 
- PRD specifies basic extraction (6 categories)
- Implementation includes comprehensive Ignatian analysis (11 categories)
- Enhanced extraction includes service orientation, growth indicators, character strengths
- Implementation aligns better with Ignatian pedagogy than original PRD specs
**Documentation Needed**: 
- Update PRD to reflect enhanced Context extraction approach
- Document rationale for expanded extraction fields
**Testing**: Need to verify all extraction fields work correctly
**Status**: Analysis complete, development tasks updated

- Modified: /frontend/src/pages/context/ContextStage.tsx
- Modified: /frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
- Modified: /frontend/src/App.tsx
- Modified: docs/development-notes.md
