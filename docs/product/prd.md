# Ignatian AI Augmentation Agent — PRD (MVP)

### TL;DR

The Ignatian AI Augmentation Agent is a web app for students that converts
their resumes and job listings into tailored portfolio project plans. The app
offers two distinct paths: **Exploration Mode** for students researching
opportunities (upload 3-5 job descriptions to create one multi-purpose project)
and **Interview Prep Mode** for students with secured interviews (focused
single-job project). By embedding the Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm (IPP)—where
Context means uploading your RESUME and Experience means uploading JOB
DESCRIPTIONS—the app helps students create **portfolio projects** that
demonstrate exact skills employers seek while reflecting personal values. The
Multi-Target approach in Exploration Mode analyzes overlapping requirements to
generate strategic projects that address multiple roles simultaneously. Current
MVP uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini across all stages. Authentication via Google
sign-in. The outcome: compelling portfolio projects that lead to meaningful
employment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation Status

### Current MVP Implementation
The application currently uses a **single LLM architecture** with OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model
handling all IPP stages. This simplified approach has proven effective for the MVP, delivering
80% of the envisioned value with 20% of the complexity.

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Single Model**: GPT-4o-mini handles all document analysis, synthesis, and generation
- **Document-Based**: Analysis limited to uploaded resume and job description content

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functional Requirements

**IPP Framing and Flow (Critical Priority)**

The app's entire user journey mirrors the five-stage Ignatian
Pedagogical Paradigm. Each stage is distinctive and powered by
LLM-driven personalization:

1.  **Context (Resume Upload - Understanding Who You Are)**

    **Pedagogical Purpose**: The Context phase is about understanding the whole person - their background, skills, experiences, and values. This is why students upload their RESUME here, not job descriptions.

    **Current Implementation:**
    - Student signs in with Google and selects their path (Exploration or Interview Prep)
    - **Uploads RESUME ONLY** via drag-and-drop interface
    - LLM extracts comprehensive personal context from resume:
      - Personal information (name, location, contact)
      - Education details (school, major, graduation date, GPA)
      - Work experience and internships
      - Skills inventory (technical and soft skills)
      - Extracurricular activities and leadership roles
      - Inferred values and interests based on experiences
    - Presents extracted data for quick verification
    - Asks 2-3 minimal supplemental questions:
      - Location preference (if different from resume)
      - Top 2 career priorities (from quick selection list)
      - Year in school (if unclear from graduation date)
    - **NO job descriptions uploaded in this phase** - that comes in Experience
    
    **Key Point**: Context is about the STUDENT, not the jobs. We establish who they are before exploring what opportunities exist.
    
    **Escape Hatch**: After initial context gathering: "Ready to explore opportunities?" or "Want to add more context about yourself?"

    **Future Enhancements:**
    - Progressive context capture throughout journey
    - Skills self-assessment tools
    - Values inventory questionnaire
    - Optional deeper profiling for power users

2.  **Experience (Job Description Upload - Exploring Opportunities)**

      Ignatian process, using LLM-powered questions to prompt students to 
      grapple with meaning, purpose, and interpersonal connection.

    - **Values-Based Questioning**: Prompts probe four key areas:
      * Values alignment: "What deeper values do you see reflected in work that energizes you?"
      * Service to others: "How does this role allow you to be 'a person for others'?"
      * Personal mission: "What unique contribution do you sense you're called to make?"
      * Growth opportunities: "Where do tensions or challenges invite you to grow?"

    - **Integrated Experience**: The synthesis naturally flows into reflection, 
      creating a seamless bridge from intellectual understanding to 
      heart-centered meaning-making.

    - **Deep Engagement**: App encourages thoughtful written reflection with

The core innovation for Exploration Mode is the sophisticated overlap analysis that identifies common requirements across multiple job descriptions:

#### 1. **Requirement Extraction Pipeline**
```python
def analyze_job_overlap(job_descriptions: List[str]):
    # Extract from each job:
    requirements = {
        'technologies': extract_technologies(job),
        'skills': extract_skills(job),
        'responsibilities': extract_responsibilities(job),
        'tools': extract_tools(job)
    }
    return requirements
```

#### 2. **Overlap Scoring System**
- **Technology Frequency**: Count occurrences across all jobs
- **Skill Importance**: Weight by how prominently featured
- **Responsibility Similarity**: Semantic matching of similar tasks
- **Tool Ecosystem**: Group related tools (e.g., React + Redux + Jest)

#### 3. **Coverage Optimization**
The AI optimizes for maximum coverage with minimum complexity:
- Prioritize technologies appearing in 60%+ of jobs
- Include "bridge technologies" that connect different roles
- Balance breadth vs. depth of demonstration
- Consider implementation time vs. coverage gain

#### 4. **Project Generation Logic**
```python
def generate_multi_target_project(overlap_analysis, student_values):
    # Find optimal project type
    project_ideas = []
    for project_type in PROJECT_TEMPLATES:
        coverage = calculate_coverage(project_type, overlap_analysis)
        alignment = calculate_values_alignment(project_type, student_values)
        complexity = estimate_complexity(project_type)
        
        score = (coverage * 0.5) + (alignment * 0.3) + (1/complexity * 0.2)
        project_ideas.append((project_type, score, coverage_breakdown))
    
    return top_3_projects_by_score(project_ideas)
```
