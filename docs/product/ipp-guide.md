# Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm Guide for Career Development App

## Overview
The Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm (IPP) consists of five interconnected phases that create a holistic learning experience. This guide outlines how each phase applies to your career development application, with the ultimate goal of helping students create **portfolio projects** that demonstrate their skills to employers while reflecting their personal values. These projects serve as tangible proof of capability and significantly increase job placement success.

Based on the authoritative ICAJE document "Ignatian Pedagogy: A Practical Approach" (1993).

If reflection reveals misalignment: "Would you like to explore why this doesn't fit?" 
Capture learning and redirect to new opportunities.

## Critical Design Principles

### 1. **Clear Upload Distinction**
- **Context Phase**: Students upload their RESUME (understanding who they are)
- **Experience Phase**: Students upload JOB DESCRIPTIONS (exploring opportunities)
- This separation maintains pedagogical integrity

### 2. **Portfolio-Centric Process**
- Every phase builds toward creating compelling portfolio projects
- Job descriptions are mined for specific project opportunities
- Projects demonstrate exact skills employers seek
- Values integration makes projects unique and memorable

### 3. **Cyclical, Not Linear**
- Users can return to any phase based on discoveries
- Each cycle deepens understanding
- No "failure," only learning

### 4. **Whole Person Focus**
- Address cognitive, affective, and spiritual dimensions
- Value human development alongside professional progress
- Form competent, conscious, and compassionate professionals

### 5. **Freedom and Flexibility**
- Multiple exit points honor discernment
- Pivoting is reframed as clarity
- "No" is as valuable as "yes"

### 6. **Service Orientation**
- Every phase considers impact on others
- Develops "men and women for others"
- Career as vocation, not just employment

### 7. **Accompaniment Model**
- App facilitates but doesn't dictate
- Respects individual journey
- Provides structure with flexibility
