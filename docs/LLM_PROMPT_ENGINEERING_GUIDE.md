    # ... additional template methods
```

### 3. Error Handling & Validation
**Implementation**: Enhanced JSON parsing with multiple fallback strategies

```python
def _parse_json_response_enhanced(self, response: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Enhanced JSON parsing with better error handling and validation"""
    try:
        response = response.strip()
        return json.loads(response)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        # Try multiple extraction patterns
        json_patterns = [
            r'```json\s*(\{.*\})\s*```',
            r'```\s*(\{.*\})\s*```',
            r'(\{.*\})'
        ]
        
        for pattern in json_patterns:
            json_match = re.search(pattern, response, re.DOTALL)
            if json_match:
                try:
                    return json.loads(json_match.group(1))
                except json.JSONDecodeError:
                    continue
        
        # Structured error response if all parsing fails
        return {
            "error": "Failed to parse LLM response as JSON",
            "raw_response": response,
            "timestamp": "2024-12-18T10:30:00Z",
            "parsing_attempts": len(json_patterns)
        }
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation

```python
from app.services.enhanced_llm_service import enhanced_llm_service

# Resume analysis with user context
user_context = {
    'academic_level': 'undergraduate',
    'major': 'business administration',
    'career_stage': 'junior seeking internships',
    'values_focus': 'social justice and service'
}

resume_analysis = await enhanced_llm_service.analyze_resume_enhanced(
    resume_text=resume_content,
    user_context=user_context
)

# Job description analysis
job_analysis = await enhanced_llm_service.analyze_job_description_enhanced(
    job_text=job_content,
    user_context=user_context
)

    connections = await enhanced_llm_service.find_connections_enhanced(resume_analysis, job_analysis, user_context)
    context_summary = await enhanced_llm_service.generate_context_summary_enhanced(resume_analysis, job_analysis, connections, user_context)
    
    # Stage 2: Experience (user selects experiences in frontend)
    selected_experiences = get_user_selected_experiences()  # From frontend
    
    # Stage 3: Reflection
    synthesis = await enhanced_llm_service.generate_reflection_synthesis_enhanced(selected_experiences, connections, user_context)
    reflection_prompts = await enhanced_llm_service.generate_ignatian_reflection_prompts_enhanced(synthesis, user_context)
    
    # Stage 4: Action (after user completes reflections)
    reflection_responses = get_user_reflection_responses()  # From frontend
    portfolio_project = await enhanced_llm_service.generate_portfolio_project_enhanced(synthesis, reflection_responses, user_context)
    
    # Stage 5: Evaluation
    interview_questions = await enhanced_llm_service.generate_interview_questions_enhanced(portfolio_project, connections, user_context)
    
    return {

        'reflection_prompts': reflection_prompts,
        'portfolio_project': portfolio_project,
        'interview_questions': interview_questions
    }
```

### Error Handling Example

```python
async def safe_llm_call_with_fallback(prompt: str, user_context: Dict[str, Any]):
    try:
        # Primary LLM call
        response = await enhanced_llm_service._call_openai_enhanced(prompt, user_context)
        parsed_response = enhanced_llm_service._parse_json_response_enhanced(response)
        
        # Check confidence score
        if parsed_response.get('metadata', {}).get('confidence_score', 0) < 0.7:
            # Log low confidence and potentially retry
            logger.warning(f"Low confidence response: {parsed_response.get('metadata', {}).get('confidence_score')}")
        
        return parsed_response
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Fallback to basic analysis
        logger.error(f"Enhanced LLM call failed: {str(e)}")
        return enhanced_llm_service._create_error_response("analysis", str(e))
```

## Maintenance & Updates

### Version Control

**Current Version**: v2.0
**Location**: `prompt_templates.py` → `PROMPT_VERSION = "v2.0"`

**Versioning Strategy**:
- **Major versions** (2.0, 3.0): Significant prompt restructuring or new techniques
- **Minor versions** (2.1, 2.2): Additional prompts or enhanced schemas
- **Patch versions** (2.1.1, 2.1.2): Bug fixes and minor improvements

### Prompt Updates

**Regular Maintenance Tasks**:

3. **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user suggestions and pain points
4. **LLM Model Updates**: Adapt prompts for new model capabilities

**Update Process**:
```python
# Example prompt update with version tracking
def update_prompt_template(template_name: str, new_content: str, version: str):
    """Update prompt template with proper version tracking"""
    
    # Backup current version
    backup_prompt(template_name, current_version)
    
    # Update template
    templates[template_name] = {
        'content': new_content,
        'version': version,
        'updated_at': datetime.now(),
        'changelog': get_changelog(template_name, version)
    }
    
    # Validate new template
    validate_prompt_template(template_name)
```

### Quality Assurance

**Testing Framework**:
```python
async def test_prompt_quality(prompt_template: str, test_cases: List[Dict]):
    """Test prompt quality across multiple scenarios"""
    
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        response = await enhanced_llm_service._call_openai_enhanced(
            prompt_template.format(**test_case['inputs']),
            test_case['user_context']
        )
        
        # Validate response structure
        parsed = enhanced_llm_service._parse_json_response_enhanced(response)
        
        # Check required fields
        quality_score = validate_response_completeness(parsed, test_case['expected_fields'])
        
        # Assess Ignatian integration
        values_score = assess_ignatian_integration(parsed)
        
        results.append({
            'test_case': test_case['name'],
            'quality_score': quality_score,
            'values_score': values_score,
            'confidence': parsed.get('metadata', {}).get('confidence_score', 0)
        })
    
    return results
```

    Enhanced resume analysis prompt with chain-of-thought reasoning and Ignatian lens.
    
    This prompt analyzes resumes through five stages:
    1. Journey pattern recognition
    2. Character and values identification  
    3. Technical competency extraction
    4. Growth mindset assessment
    5. Ignatian values alignment
    
    Args:
        resume_text: Raw text content of the resume
        
    Returns:
        Formatted prompt string with embedded resume content
        
    Ignatian Integration:
        - Focuses on service orientation and collaboration evidence
        - Assesses character strengths beyond technical skills
        - Identifies values indicators in experience choices
        - Connects experiences to potential for serving others
