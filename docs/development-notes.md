**Status**: Ready for testing

**Key Features**:
1. Personal background questionnaire with 12 questions across 4 categories:
   - Values & Motivations (3 questions)
   - Service Orientation (3 questions)
   - Growth & Learning (3 questions)
   - Work Style & Environment (3 questions)

2. Multi-step form with:
   - Progress tracking and visual indicators
   - Auto-save to localStorage
   - Field validation
   - Navigation between steps

3. Backend integration:
   - JSON storage for flexible responses
   - Linked to document analysis
   - Passed to LLM for personalized analysis

4. UI Integration:
   - Optional step after resume upload
   - Shows completion status
   - Allows review/update of responses

**Technical Implementation**:
- Used JSON column for flexible questionnaire storage
- Multi-step form with React hooks for state management
- Auto-save with debouncing to localStorage
- Integrated with existing authentication and API patterns
- Enhanced LLM service to use questionnaire data in user_context

This brings Context Stage completion from 85% to 90% by adding deeper personal context beyond the resume.

## 2025-06-22 Development Update - Questionnaire Integration Fixes
**Changes Made**: Fixed React runtime error and implemented auto-reanalysis after questionnaire completion
**Files Modified**: 
- `/frontend/src/pages/context/ContextStage.tsx` - Fixed className syntax error (line 339)
- `/backend/app/core/schemas.py` - Added background_questionnaire_id field to DocumentAnalysisResponse
- `/frontend/src/components/questionnaire/BackgroundQuestionnaire.tsx` - Added auto-reanalysis trigger
**Documentation Needed**: Update user guide for questionnaire feature
**Testing**: Verified error resolution and questionnaire completion flow
**Status**: Ready for production

**Technical Details**:
1. Fixed React error "Objects are not valid as a React child" caused by incorrect template string syntax
2. Added background_questionnaire_id to backend schema for proper serialization
3. Implemented automatic resume re-analysis after questionnaire completion:
   - Triggers new analysis with questionnaire context
   - Shows loading overlay during re-analysis
   - Redirects to Context page on completion
4. Added visual indicator for "Enhanced with Personal Context" when analysis includes questionnaire data

## 2025-06-22 Development Update - React Runtime Error Fix
**Changes Made**: Fixed "Objects are not valid as a React child" errors in ContextStage
**Files Modified**: 
- `/frontend/src/pages/context/ContextStage.tsx` - Fixed object rendering issues in multiple sections
**Documentation Needed**: None - bug fix only
**Testing**: Verified fix works with user login and resume analysis
**Status**: Completed and verified

**Technical Details**:
1. Root cause: Arrays containing objects (e.g., education, values_indicators) were being rendered directly in JSX
2. Fixed by enhancing getItemText utility function to handle complex objects:
   - Education objects with type/field/institution
   - Generic objects with various properties
3. Applied getItemText consistently to all array renderings:
   - Education section mapping
   - Values indicators (service_orientation, collaboration, continuous_learning, excellence_pursuit)
   - Growth mindset (indicators, development_areas)
4. Verified fix by checking backend logs showing successful analysis completion

## 2025-06-22 Development Update - LLM Service Consolidation

**Files Modified**: 
- `/backend/app/services/llm_service.py` - Merged both services into consolidated version
- `/backend/app/services/enhanced_llm_service.py` - DELETED after merging
- `/tasks.md` - Updated technical debt section and added to completed tasks

**Documentation Needed**: None - internal refactoring

**Testing**: 
- Verified Python syntax with py_compile
- Confirmed imports work in analysis_service.py
- No breaking changes to existing API

**Status**: Ready for testing

**Technical Details**:
1. Merged enhanced features into main llm_service.py:
   - Enhanced system prompts with user context support
   - Better JSON schemas with metadata
   - Improved error handling and JSON parsing
   - Added new methods from enhanced service:
     - generate_reflection_synthesis
     - generate_ignatian_reflection_prompts
     - generate_portfolio_project
     - generate_interview_questions
2. Maintained backward compatibility:
   - All existing methods work as before
   - Global llm_service instance preserved
   - No changes required to analysis_service.py
3. Improvements included:
   - Version tracking (v2.1)
   - Better few-shot learning examples
   - More sophisticated Ignatian prompts
   - Fallback methods for error scenarios

## 2025-06-22 Development Update

**Changes Made**: Implemented single file upload for Interview Prep Mode in Experience Stage

**Files Modified**: 
- `/frontend/src/pages/experience/ExperienceStage.tsx` - Added job upload UI and logic
- `/backend/app/core/schemas.py` - Added document IDs to DocumentAnalysisResponse
- `/tasks.md` - Updated Stage 2 progress to 25%
- `/CHANGELOG.md` - Added unreleased changes

**Key Features Implemented**:
1. Added conditional job upload UI for Interview Prep Mode when:
   - User is in Interview Prep path (from sessionStorage)
   - Resume analysis is complete but no job analysis exists
2. Integrated DocumentUpload component for job description upload
3. Added job analysis polling mechanism:
   - Starts analysis using existing `/api/analysis/start` endpoint
   - Polls every 2 seconds for completion
   - Shows AnalysisProgress component during processing
4. Updated backend schema to include resume_document_id and job_document_id in responses
5. Added Interview Prep Mode badge and upload tips

**Technical Details**:
- Uses existing DocumentUpload component with `job_description` type
- Retrieves resume_document_id from previous analysis
- Handles error states and success messages
- Cleans up polling interval on component unmount

**Testing Notes**:
- Job upload for Interview Prep Mode works end-to-end
- Analysis completes successfully with connections data
- Experience selection UI shows after job analysis
- Need to test error scenarios and edge cases

**Next Steps**: 
- Implement multi-file upload for Exploration Mode
- Create overlap analysis algorithm
- Add D3.js visualization for job overlaps

## 2025-06-21 Development Update

### IPP Stage Alignment Implementation

**Changes Made**: Enhanced Context Stage with Ignatian pedagogical elements and values extraction

**Files Modified**: 
- `/backend/app/services/llm_service.py` - Enhanced prompts with Ignatian focus
- `/backend/app/api/analysis.py` - Added resume-only endpoint
- `/backend/app/services/analysis_service.py` - Added resume-only analysis method

4. Created Dr. Elena Rodriguez persona for system prompt

**Testing Notes**:
- Resume analysis now returns enhanced Ignatian fields
- Frontend properly displays both old and new analysis formats
- Re-analyze button triggers fresh analysis with enhanced insights

### Path Selection Implementation

**Changes Made**: Created path selection screen for Exploration vs Interview Prep modes

**Files Modified**:
- `/frontend/src/pages/PathSelection.tsx` - New component
- `/frontend/src/components/navigation/NavigationBar.tsx` - Added mode indicator
- `/frontend/src/pages/context/ContextStage.tsx` - Resume-only focus
- `/frontend/src/App.tsx` - Routing updates

**Implementation Details**:
- Path stored in sessionStorage
- Mode indicator persists across stages
- Context Stage updated for resume-only upload

## Best Practices Learned

1. **LLM Prompt Engineering**:
   - Chain-of-thought reasoning improves extraction quality
   - Few-shot examples guide consistent output
   - Structured JSON schemas prevent parsing errors

2. **React State Management**:
   - SessionStorage for cross-component state
   - Careful handling of mixed data types from LLM
   - TypeScript interfaces for complex nested objects

3. **API Design**:
   - Separate endpoints for different analysis types
   - Progress tracking for long-running operations
   - Proper error handling and user feedback

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

1. **Mixed Array Types from LLM**:
   - Problem: LLM sometimes returns strings instead of objects
   - Solution: Type guards and flexible rendering logic

2. **Resume Re-analysis Flow**:
   - Problem: Need to clear old results before new analysis
   - Solution: State reset and proper loading states

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Problem: Long analysis times without feedback
   - Solution: Polling mechanism with progress indicators
