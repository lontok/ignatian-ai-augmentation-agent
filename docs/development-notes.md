# Development Notes

## 2025-06-22 Development Update

**Changes Made**: Implemented single file upload for Interview Prep Mode in Experience Stage

**Files Modified**: 
- `/frontend/src/pages/experience/ExperienceStage.tsx` - Added job upload UI and logic
- `/backend/app/core/schemas.py` - Added document IDs to DocumentAnalysisResponse
- `/tasks.md` - Updated Stage 2 progress to 25%
- `/CHANGELOG.md` - Added unreleased changes

**Key Features Implemented**:
1. Added conditional job upload UI for Interview Prep Mode when:
   - User is in Interview Prep path (from sessionStorage)

2. Integrated DocumentUpload component for job description upload
3. Added job analysis polling mechanism:
   - Starts analysis using existing `/api/analysis/start` endpoint
   - Polls every 2 seconds for completion
   - Shows AnalysisProgress component during processing
4. Updated backend schema to include resume_document_id and job_document_id in responses
5. Added Interview Prep Mode badge and upload tips

**Technical Details**:
- Uses existing DocumentUpload component with `job_description` type
- Retrieves resume_document_id from previous analysis
- Handles error states and success messages
- Cleans up polling interval on component unmount

**Documentation Needed**: 
- Update PRD to reflect Experience Stage job upload flow for Interview Prep Mode
- Document the conditional UI behavior based on analysis state

**Testing**:

- Verify transition from upload to experience selection after analysis

**Status**: Ready for documentation review and testing
