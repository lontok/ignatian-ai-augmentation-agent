- **Sync**: Documentation periodically merges from main to stay current

## Current Development Status
- Status: Development Claude ACTIVE and ready for work
- Development branch: main
- Documentation branch: docs-workspace
- Last update: 2024-12-29

## Current Development Tasks

## 2025-06-21 Context Stage Gap Analysis

### Current Implementation vs Requirements

**What's Currently Built:**
1. ✅ Document upload (resume + job description)
2. ✅ LLM analysis pipeline (5-step process)
3. ✅ Progress tracking during analysis
4. ✅ Strengths/gaps identification
5. ✅ Detailed evidence table with connections
6. ✅ Role-fit narrative generation

**Critical Gaps from IPP Guide Requirements:**

1. **Personal Background Collection** (IPP Guide Phase 1)
   - ❌ No intake questionnaire for personal context
   - ❌ No family expectations/cultural values capture
   - ❌ No financial situation assessment
   - ❌ No geographic preferences collection
   - ❌ No personal relationships/commitments info
   - ❌ No health/life circumstances consideration

2. **Academic Profile** (IPP Guide Phase 1)
   - ❌ No major/minor/year collection
   - ❌ No GPA/achievements tracking
   - ❌ No coursework inventory
   - ❌ No extracurricular activities capture

3. **Professional Starting Point** (IPP Guide Phase 1)
   - ⚠️ Partial - resume parsing exists but no structured capture of:
     - Career assumptions/biases
     - Professional network info
     - Industry knowledge level

4. **Personal Story & Values** (IPP Guide emphasis)
   - ❌ No personal story prompts
   - ❌ No values inventory
   - ❌ No motivation/mission capture
   - ❌ No "Who is this person?" exploration

5. **Skills Inventory** (PRD requirement)
   - ⚠️ Partial - extracted from resume but no:
     - Self-assessment of skill levels
     - Skills categorization (technical/soft/transferable)
     - Skills the student wants to develop

**Critical Missing Features:**
- **Comprehensive intake questionnaire** before document upload
- **Personal story prompts** to understand the whole person
- **Background assessment tools** for context
- **Skills self-assessment** beyond resume extraction

**Impact of Gaps:**
- LLM lacks personal context for meaningful personalization
- Cannot tailor advice to student's life circumstances
- Missing values/motivations that should inform project suggestions
- No baseline for measuring growth through IPP journey

**Recommendation:**
Add a pre-upload questionnaire/wizard that captures personal context, making the Context stage truly about "understanding the whole person" as the IPP requires.
